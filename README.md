### Prerequisites
Tabular Editor uses the [Tabular Object Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt706505.aspx) to load and save metadata to and from Model.bim files or existing databases. For this reason, make sure you have the latest AMO libraries available before installing Tabular Editor. They can be downloaded from the [SQL Server 2016 Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52676) (Click "Download" and choose either "\X64\SQL_AS_AMO.msi" or "\X86\SQL_AS_AMO.msi").
